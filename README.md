# Iris-analysis
## Overview
This project explores the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The goal is to analyze the dataset and build a classification model to predict the species.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Visualized relationships between features.
3. Built a Random Forest classifier to predict species.

## Results
- The dataset is balanced with 50 samples per species.
- Petal length and width are strong indicators of species.
- The model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Iris-Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis.
